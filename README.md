# MovieDeck

It is a website where you can create your own movie lists and rate these lists. It is basically based on the list system of the IMDB site. When I first started the project, I aimed to have it only as a web client, but later I integrated Web Api for mobile clients as well. In other words, the API and the web app work together

In the project, member transactions and list crud transactions are carried out dynamically in our own database. I obtained the movie information through OMDB API
